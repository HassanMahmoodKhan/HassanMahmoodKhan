### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A recent graduate from Concordia University Montreal, holding a Master's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering, I am fueled by a profound passion for Machine Learning & Data Science. Actively immersed in captivating projects, I focus on deploying efficient end-to-end machine learning workflows across diverse domains, encompassing areas such as computer vision, predictive modeling, classification, regression, and more. Beyond my expertise in machine learning, I possess a strong foundation in data analytics and processing, gained through hands-on experience. I eagerly embrace opportunities to utilize tools like relational databases and business intelligence tools, leveraging them to advance project objectives.
